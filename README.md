# Network Selection Simulation in 6G Vehicular Enviroment   
In this simulation a network selection algorithm is proposed to select the most appropriate access point when an autonomous vehicle navigates in the environment. The environment is designed incorporating the new aerial access networks introduced by the 6th generation. 

The simulation is created in Python and will use a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm for the final decision making. It simulates vehicles entering,navigating and exiting a predetermined enviroment consisitng of 5G gNB nodes and UAV nodes. While the vehicles navigate the enviroment and has the need to perform a handover, the DQN algorithm will select the best access point to handover.
